### ToolBox library for C 


A library that contain simple C shortcut or integration to ensure that every single time in any bit C project i did't rewrite the 
same function over and over again to have some advantage. So the ToolBox contain simple library or other thing that sometime turn to 
be useful. 

By the fact that this is something desined for me what's inside may change over time.
